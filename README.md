### Challenges and Bugs
Some of the challenges encountered were choosing the best technology stack for the application. Our team was not too familiar with blockchain, and how to create decentralized applications. We toyed with the idea of using Hyperledger, but ultimately chose Ethereum as there is more support and documentation, and ease of integration.<br>

For the backend we had originally planned to create the REST APIs using C++, but opted for Python using the Flask framework for ease of use, and to reduce complexity/research to project. Exploring how to create decentralized applications, and interact with blockchain in C++ is something that we will explore in the future.


### Deployment

We deployed our project using a combination of cloud services, including AWS and Firebase.

### Performance
For performance we are focusing on using Firebase and Google Analytics to ensure optimal user experience.

### Security

For security we have chosen to centralize our monitoring and logging using various AWS Services:
- AWS CloudWatch
- CloudTrail
- Organizations


## Future Aspects

In future iterations, we plan to focus on the following areas:

- Enhancing user engagement and support through a dedicated community forum.
- Incorporating user testimonials to enhance credibility and user engagement.
- Implementing an immutable database to ensure transparency and integrity of companies' diversity data.
- Offering comprehensive training and mentorship opportunities to empower job seekers and enhance their skill sets.
- Enhancing observability and logging capabilities for better monitoring and troubleshooting.
